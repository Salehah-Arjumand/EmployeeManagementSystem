# ðŸ§¾ Employee Management & Payroll System

This Java application is designed to assist a payroll clerk in managing employee records, calculating weekly and monthly pays, tracking holiday entitlements, and processing productivity bonuses. It simulates a real-world payroll system for a company employing both full-time and part-time workers.

## ðŸ“– Overview

The system categorizes employees into two types:

- **Full-time employees**
  - Receive **monthly salary** (paid every 4th week).
  - Entitled to **holiday leave**: 20 days + 1 extra day per 3 full years of service.
  - Can receive **productivity-based bonuses** (percentage-based).
  - Holiday and bonus requests must be approved by a **manager**.

- **Part-time employees**
  - Paid **weekly wage** based on **days worked**.
  - **No holiday entitlement**.
  - Paid every week.

This application automates weekly payroll generation, employee management, and holiday/bonus tracking using object-oriented principles like **inheritance** and **encapsulation**.
